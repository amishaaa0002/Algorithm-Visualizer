# Algorithm Visualizer
Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based tool that allows you to interactively explore various algorithms, including sorting algorithms and Binary Search Tree (BST) operations. With this project, you can gain a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work by visualizing their step-by-step execution.
